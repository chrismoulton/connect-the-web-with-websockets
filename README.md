# [Connect the Web With WebSockets][published url]
## Instructor: [Daniel Stern][instructor url]


WebSockets make it possible to have interactive, two-way communication sessions between the user's browser and a server. With this API, you can receive event-driven messages without having to poll the server for updates. This makes WebSockets a powerful and efficient tool for building interactive websites.

Libraries such as Socket.io make it easy to integrate WebSockets into the front-end and back-end of a site. In this course, Tuts+ instructor Daniel Stern will show you how to build a real-time, link sharing application that uses Express and Socket.io.
